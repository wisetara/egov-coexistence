 * This Event listener class sets the audit properties createdBy, createdDate

 * pre-insert events. The pre-update event was chosen instead of save-update
 * events for setting modified properties to fix a bug where even for object
 * reads the Hibernate objects were getting updated. However, the save-update
 * event is still required for new objects (inserts) as Hibernate checks for
 * not-null constraints before the pre-update event is fired. Due to auto
 * flushing strategy that we use, every transaction commit causes a
 * session.flush to be called. Flush calls cascade of collections or properties
 * which fires the save-update event if cascade value is anything other than
 * Cascade.NONE.
