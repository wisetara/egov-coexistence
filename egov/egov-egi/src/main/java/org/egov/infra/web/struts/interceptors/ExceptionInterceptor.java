 * This class overrides the default behaviour for transaction management. The transaction is marked for rollback, so that the HibSessionServletFilter further down the filter stack will rollback the
 * current transaction. For this to work, an exception mapping for the exception thrown needs to be defined in the struts.xml:
 *
 * <pre>
 *       &lt;global-results&gt;
 *           &lt;result name=&quot;genericError&quot;&gt;/error/error.jsp&lt;/result&gt;
