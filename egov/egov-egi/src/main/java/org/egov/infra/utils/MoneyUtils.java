     * E.g. An amount of 100 and weights (3, 8) will give (28, 72).

     * In such cases, the individual split amounts might not exactly match the
     * number you'd get from floating-point calculation (27.272 and 72.727 in
     * the example above). With the input amount in paise, the individual split
     * amounts will be at most 1 paisa off.
     * <p>
     * It is the job of the caller to do the "massaging" of rupee amounts into
     * paise amounts, and vice-versa for the output.
     * <p>
     * See the unit tests for more examples.
     *
     * @param amountInPaise Has to be whole number, so if your amount is Rs. 100.342,
     *                      you'll have to convert that to 10034 paise.
     * @param weights       Numbers that specify the weight given to each split. They need
     *                      not add up to 100% (e.g. 3, 3, 4) - any arbitrary weights will
     *                      do. Also note that (2, 10, 16) is identical to (1, 5, 8).

     * input amount will be returned.
